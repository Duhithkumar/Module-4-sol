		// NOTE! The steps in this file are basically identical to the ones you
// performed in the SpeakHello.js file.

// STEP 6: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakGoodBye.js inside of an IIFE
// See Lecture 52, part 2


// STEP 7: Create an object, called 'byeSpeaker' to which you will attach
// the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
// See Lecture 52, part 1
// var byeSpeaker =

// DO NOT attach the speakWord variable to the 'byeSpeaker' object.
var byeSpeaker = " Good Bye ";

// STEP 8: Rewrite the 'speak' function such that it is attached to the
// byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
// See Lecture 52, part 2
(function speak(name)
{console.log(byeSpeaker + "Duhith Kumar" );
})();

// STEP 9: Expose the 'byeSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
// 'byeSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
// xxxx.xxxx = byeSpeaker;
